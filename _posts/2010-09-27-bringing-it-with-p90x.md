I decided to start seriously exercising. We'll see if I can keep it up, but I'm
starting P90X. It's a 90-day workout that you can do from home. The only things
that you need are weights and a pull-up bar or stretchy resistance band things.
We already had weights, so we didn't need much, but we also got a heart rate
monitor (to measure if we're really bringing it or not) and a mat. Each day you
just watch a movie where the guy tells youwhat to do. Each workout takes about
an hour. One day a week you have the option of just resting or stretching.

To start out, I took the fit test.
([Click here to see the test](http://teambeachbody.com/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=f9e53d48-c3f2-4b25-96d4-23f8f015c372&groupId=10137)).
The fit test will tell you if you're in good enough shape to start this workout
(pretty much everyone is). It is also nice because I'll do the fit test again
at the end of the 90 days and I'll be able to see myprogress. Here's what I was
able to do on the test:

? pullups (I didn't do them because our pull-up bar isn't here yet)  
14" vertical  
40 pushups  
5.5" away from my toes when I try to touch them (so far away!)  
4 mins before I fall to the ground on the wall squat (or invisible chair)  
17 reps with 22.5 pounds in each hand doing bicep curls  
61 in & outs before I couldn't do any more

Not too great, but that's why I'm doing this! I also took pictures of myself
with just shorts on in different poses :). I will spare you all and not put
those up!

There are 3 different schedules that you can do this workout on. There is the
classic workout which is basically the normal one that most people do. There is
the doubles workout that is the same as classic, but after 30 days, you do the
classic workout plus a cardio workout 3 days a week. The last one is called the
lean workout. They take the classic workout and replace some upper-body
resistance with some cardio. Apparently, alot of women like that option. Right
now, I'm determined to do the doubles workout, but since it's the same as the
classic workout, I still have plenty of time to change my mind.

So far, I've only done two workouts. I did Chest &amp; Back, Ab Ripper X and I
did Plyometrics. I feel sore everywhere. Those workouts totally kicked my butt.
I had to cheat on several of them (he says you can and sometimes even gives
alternate/easierways to do it). I'm pretty excited to get into better
shape!

The last thing that I'm doing with this workout is I'm trying to follow the
recommended diet. I'm only doing it loosely though. Basically, I read what
they've asked me to do and it seems really difficult to follow exactly, so I'm
just making sure that I don't go too far off of the diet. The first phase of
the diet is the fat shredder phase. Basically, I'm supposedto have 7 servings
of protein, 1 serving of carbs, 4 servings of veggies... it's not easy. My
modified version of the diet means that I eat as much protein as I can, as few
carbs as I can as I try to eat more fruits and vegetables than I'm used to.

Well, I guess that's my story for now. I'll keep you posted as I go through it
to let you know how it's working out for me. The key is to stick to it and
reallybring it!

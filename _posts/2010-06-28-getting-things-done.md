Everyone has a list of things that they want to do. Some people keep a mental
note of their list. Some get a little more organized when life gets more busy
and they just do something simple like write their to-dos on a piece of paper.
Everyone lives life differently and everyone likes to manage their life in
different ways.


In my last post, I briefly mentioned that I really like the
[Things iPhone app](http://culturedcode.com/things/iphone/) because it follows
the GTD (Getting Things Done) system. I really like the GTD system because I
have always found myself writing lists of things that I wanted to do. I often
feel like I'll never get everything done that I want to. I can't remember how I
found out about GTD, but when I did, it sounded like exactly what I needed. I
bought the [book by David Allen](http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280)
and I really liked the principles and the philosophy that the book talked
about.


I don't follow the GTD system completely or exactly, but I'm just going to talk
about the principles that I love that relieve a lot of stress for me.

## Get all the "stuff" out of your head

If you don't have everything that you want to get done in one spot that you
know you check regularly, then you're probably feeling stressed out. That is
because you have to remember so much. Once you can get everything into a system
that you can trust and that you know you'll check when you need to, then you
can relax.

In order to do this, you need an "inbox." This is the place that you put all of
your thoughts and everything that you need to remember. The inbox is not
organized in any way. It is just a spot that everything goes into so that you
can get it out of your head quickly. Then, you regularly go through the inbox
to organize the stuff that you put in it. This is really helpful because if you
have to organize it right when you think about it, you risk not having the time
or not feeling like organizing it. Then, you'll probably just keep it in your
mind until later. It will add stress until you either forget it or have the
time to decide what to do with it. For example, I wanted to get my dad a
present for his birthday. I know that in order to do this, there are several
small steps. But right now I don't have time or the desire to think about it
more. So, I just drop it in my inbox.

## The next action

The inbox is the only place that any item can be described vaguely. In my
example, getting my dad a present is very vague. If I am just describing it as
a present, obviously I need to spend some time brainstorming what I am going to
get him. Once I have decided, there will probably be more steps before I have
his present ready. If it is expensive, I may want to ask other family members
to pitch in with me. If it is something that I'm making for him, I will need to
purchase the parts, and spend time putting them together. All of these are
"next actions."

Next actions are clearly defined tasks that pared down to the individual tasks
that need to be completed. When something moves out of the inbox, it needs to
be defined by next actions. This way, when I have time to do something, I'm not
discouraged because I don't know exactly what to get my dad. I'm also not
discouraged because getting my dad something may be a task that I can't get
done quickly. All that I need to do in order to get something done is the next
action. I can do small next actions almost anytime.

## Organize your next actions into projects

It is clear that there may be many next actions involved with getting my dad a
gift. It is nice to have all of these organized into a project. Then, the only
next action that is pertinent to me right now is the first one in each project.

## Things you'll do someday or on a specific date

There are two other main categories that you may place your next actions. I
know that someday, I'll finish painting my model airplanes that I've had
downstairs. I don't want to forget to do it, but I'm not planning on doing it
anytime in the near future. I'm too involved with my yard project. So, I'll
just place that item in a someday pile. I check this pile regularly (maybe once
a week) just to make sure that I don't forget about it and to decide if I want
to move it out.


There are also some things that I need to do on a specific date. An example of
this is the task of actually delivering my dad's birthday gift. I need to
remember to do that, but I don't need to think about it now. So, these items
are scheduled. You can either put it on a calendar that you check, or if you
have the Things iPhone app like me, you can schedule it and it gets placed on
my today list when the day comes.

This is also a good place to schedule things that you just want to think about
later. You can schedule tasks like, "Decide what to do for Dad's gift." Then,
you don't lose track of the to-do item and you can decide later.

## Other thoughts

The system that you implement needs to be easy to do and something that you can
do anywhere so that you can easily get everything out of your head in order to
prevent stress. The main drawback to Things is that I can only enter things
in on my phone or on my Mac. When I manage lots of stuff at once, I like
doing it on my Mac. I've gotten good at typing on my iPhone, but I would
really like to enter items and manage everything from my computer at work as
well. I used a [Moleskine](Find our more about Moleskine notebooks) notebook
for a while and I really enjoyed it, but I didn't carrying it and a pen with
me everywhere.

This is the system that I've found that works best for me. What do you do?

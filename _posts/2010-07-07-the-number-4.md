Since we just celebrated the 4th of July, I was notising all of the 4's around
me. Here are all the 4's that I could think of. Are there any that I missed?

* We have 4 people in our famly now that Luke is born.
* Luke has 4 letters in his name.
* Apple recently released both iOS 4 and the iPhone 4.
* The Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 was released this year. (I use the .NET Framework for my job).
* 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42 are popular numbers in the TV series Lost. The series finale of Lost aired this year.
* The World Cup comes every 4 years.
* The Winter Olympics happen every 4 years.
* This year I will turn 28 years old. That means that this is the 4th time that I have lived 7 years.
* 4 years ago was the 250th aniversary of the birth of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

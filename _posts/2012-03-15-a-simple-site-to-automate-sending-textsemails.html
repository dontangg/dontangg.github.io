excerpt: I'm often thinking about things that I could code up that would make tasks
  simpler. &nbsp;Generally, that means that I spend a lot of time up front to write
  a tool that automates a task. &nbsp;Then, I slowly get that time back over time
  using the tool. &nbsp;But, it's fun anyways. So, this is what I decided to automate.

<p>I'm often thinking about things that I could code up that would make tasks simpler. &nbsp;Generally, that means that I spend a lot of time up front to write a tool that automates a task. &nbsp;Then, I slowly get that time back over time using the tool. &nbsp;But, it's fun anyways. So, this is what I decided to automate.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-259"></a></p>
<h2>Justification<&#47;h2><br />
<a title="My Mormon Profile" href="http:&#47;&#47;mormon.org&#47;me&#47;2ZXC&#47;" target="_blank">I am a Mormon.<&#47;a>&nbsp; No one is paid to do anything at my church. &nbsp;So, we have to setup all the chairs for everyone every Sunday. &nbsp;We have split into different groups so that we really only have to come setup chairs once every month. &nbsp;I am in charge of reminding my group that it's our turn. &nbsp;These groups change pretty often with people moving in and out, so we keep the list of groups in a Google Spreadsheet. &nbsp;I often forget that I need to remind everyone until it's inconvenient for me. &nbsp;I have often looked up the list in the Google spreadsheet on my phone and copied them, 5 at a time, into Google Voice to send texts. &nbsp;It feels painful.</p>
<h2>Solution<&#47;h2><br />
To make this easier for me, I decided to write a simple website that would read the data from the Google spreadsheet for me. Then, I could type type in my message and click "Send SMS" and be done. &nbsp;I was able to do this in about 4 days in my spare time, but there are some caveats. &nbsp;I'm going to give a brief tour of this tiny little site. &nbsp;I'm not going to talk about any of the code, but it's up on GitHub. &nbsp;If you're interested, I used <a title="Sinatra" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sinatrarb.com&#47;" target="_blank">Sinatra<&#47;a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a title="Haml" href="http:&#47;&#47;haml-lang.com&#47;" target="_blank">Haml<&#47;a>, the <a title="Google Spreadsheet API" href="https:&#47;&#47;developers.google.com&#47;google-apps&#47;spreadsheets&#47;" target="_blank">Google Spreadsheet API<&#47;a> via the <a title="Google API Ruby Client" href="http:&#47;&#47;code.google.com&#47;p&#47;google-api-ruby-client" target="_blank">Google API Ruby client<&#47;a>&nbsp;and <a title="Faraday" href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;technoweenie&#47;faraday" target="_blank">Faraday<&#47;a>, <a title="Moonshado SMS" href="https:&#47;&#47;addons.heroku.com&#47;moonshadosms" target="_blank">Moonshado SMS<&#47;a>, <a title="MongoDB" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mongodb.org&#47;" target="_blank">MongoDB<&#47;a> with <a title="Mongoid" href="http:&#47;&#47;mongoid.org&#47;" target="_blank">Mongoid<&#47;a> on <a title="MongoLab" href="https:&#47;&#47;mongolab.com&#47;home" target="_blank">MongoLab<&#47;a>, the <a title="Twitter Bootstrap" href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.github.com&#47;bootstrap&#47;" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap<&#47;a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Heroku" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.heroku.com&#47;" target="_blank">Heroku<&#47;a>. &nbsp;It was all free!!! &nbsp;If you want my code, <a title="EQ Automator on GitHub" href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;dontangg&#47;eq_automator" target="_blank">go here<&#47;a>.</p>
<h2>Short Tour<&#47;h2><br />
The home page is just a simple page with a random quote about time that changes every time you come to the page and a link to the contact page. &nbsp;I'm guessing that I might add more tools like this in the future.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.donwilson.net&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;03&#47;home3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-272" title="home" src="http:&#47;&#47;blog.donwilson.net&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;03&#47;home3.png" alt="" width="1022" height="378" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>When you click on the "Contact the quroum" link it takes you to a Google page where it tells you that I'm asking for permission to use your spreadsheets. &nbsp;If you give permission, it takes you to the only other page in the app, the contact page. &nbsp;You can select from a bunch of preset groups of contacts or you can manually click on the names to add them or remove them from the list. &nbsp;You can see who has an email or phone number in the spreadsheet with the icons next to each name. &nbsp;Then, you type in your message and click the SMS button if you want it to send a text message. &nbsp;Or, click the Email button if you want to send an email. &nbsp;The site responds to your browser size too. &nbsp;So, if you are on a mobile phone, it's still pretty usable. &nbsp;Pretty simple. &nbsp;(I removed a bunch of names and changed the names in the screenshot below).</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.donwilson.net&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;03&#47;contact.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-273" title="contact" src="http:&#47;&#47;blog.donwilson.net&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2012&#47;03&#47;contact.png" alt="" width="1022" height="551" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>One caveat is that right now, I can only send 17 text message a month for free. &nbsp;I have 19 people in my group. &nbsp;Also, when it sends the text, it adds "Msg&amp;data rates may apply txt STOP to opt-out." &nbsp;That's kind of crappy. &nbsp;Also, if I'm asking a question and they want to reply, their reply won't make it to my phone. &nbsp;So, I'm thinking of changing from using MoonShado SMS to Twilio. &nbsp;With Twilio it won't be free, but I'll get everything that I want for about $1.17&#47;month. &nbsp;I'm still deciding if it's worth it to me. &nbsp;Either way it was a fun project and I'll still use it!</p>

Lately, I've been interested in learning about people who are influential on the internet. (The most recent are David Heinemeier Hansson and Matt Mullenweg). These guys blog. It also just seems like a good thing to do. It's a way to be a little more social and it's also like keeping a journal. At the end of a year, I can go somewhere like <a title="Make your own book" href="http://www.blurb.com" target="_blank">blurb.com</a> and create a book out of my posts. So, I'm going to give it a shot.

Most of the blogs that I like reading have a focus. They don't just write about random things. I don't know what I like writing about yet, so I'm just going to write about whatever I feel like when I'm writing. Maybe I'll develop more of a focus as I go, but I won't start out that way.

One definition for the word "muse" is "the source of an artist's inspiration." For now, I thought that was a good title for the blog because even though I don't know what I'll write about, it will definitely be about things that have made me who I am. It will be my thoughts and reasonings. Maybe some of this can inspire others too.

Whatever happens here, I hope that I can enjoy it and I hope you can too! If you have something to say, please leave a reply! It will make it more fun for everyone!

  exercising. &nbsp;We'll see if I can keep it up, but I'm starting P90X. &nbsp;It's
  a 90-day workout that you can do from home. &nbsp;The only things that you need
  are weights and a pull-up bar or stretchy resistance band things. &nbsp;We already
  had weights, so we didn't need much, but we also got a heart rate monitor (to measure
  if we're really bringing it or not) and a mat. &nbsp;Each day you just watch a movie
  where the guy tells you&nbsp;what to do. &nbsp;Each workout takes about an hour.
  &nbsp;One day a week you have the option of just resting or stretching.\r\n\r\nTo
  start out, I took the fit test. &nbsp;(<a title=\"P90X Fit test\" href=\"http:&#47;&#47;teambeachbody.com&#47;c&#47;document_library&#47;get_file?uuid=f9e53d48-c3f2-4b25-96d4-23f8f015c372&amp;groupId=10137\"
  target=\"_blank\">Click here to see the test<&#47;a>). &nbsp;The fit test will tell
  you if you're in good enough shape to start this workout (pretty much everyone is).
  &nbsp;It is also nice because I'll do the fit test again at the end of the 90 days
  and I'll be able to see my&nbsp;progress. &nbsp;Here's what I was able to do on
  the test:\r\n\r\n"

  content: I'm so proud of you! After talking to you I got a little closer to getting
    serious about making some lifestyle changes.

<p>I decided to start seriously exercising. &nbsp;We'll see if I can keep it up, but I'm starting P90X. &nbsp;It's a 90-day workout that you can do from home. &nbsp;The only things that you need are weights and a pull-up bar or stretchy resistance band things. &nbsp;We already had weights, so we didn't need much, but we also got a heart rate monitor (to measure if we're really bringing it or not) and a mat. &nbsp;Each day you just watch a movie where the guy tells you&nbsp;what to do. &nbsp;Each workout takes about an hour. &nbsp;One day a week you have the option of just resting or stretching.</p>
<p>To start out, I took the fit test. &nbsp;(<a title="P90X Fit test" href="http:&#47;&#47;teambeachbody.com&#47;c&#47;document_library&#47;get_file?uuid=f9e53d48-c3f2-4b25-96d4-23f8f015c372&amp;groupId=10137" target="_blank">Click here to see the test<&#47;a>). &nbsp;The fit test will tell you if you're in good enough shape to start this workout (pretty much everyone is). &nbsp;It is also nice because I'll do the fit test again at the end of the 90 days and I'll be able to see my&nbsp;progress. &nbsp;Here's what I was able to do on the test:</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-86"></a>? pullups (I didn't do them because our pull-up bar isn't here yet)<br />
14" vertical<br />
40 pushups<br />
5.5" away from my toes when I try to touch them (so far away!)<br />
4 mins before I fall to the ground on the wall squat (or invisible chair)<br />
17 reps with 22.5 pounds in each hand doing bicep curls<br />
61 in &amp; outs before I couldn't do any more</p>
<p>Not too great, but that's why I'm doing this! &nbsp;I also took pictures of myself with just shorts on in different poses :). &nbsp;I will spare you all and not put those up!</p>
<p>There are 3 different schedules that you can do this workout on. &nbsp;There is the classic workout which is basically the normal one that most people do. &nbsp;There is the doubles workout that is the same as classic, but after 30 days, you do the classic workout plus a cardio workout 3 days a week. &nbsp;The last one is called the lean workout. &nbsp;They take the classic workout and replace some upper-body resistance with some cardio. &nbsp;Apparently, a&nbsp;lot of women like that option. &nbsp;Right now, I'm determined to do the doubles workout, but since it's the same as the classic workout, I still have plenty of time to change my mind.</p>
<p>So far, I've only done two workouts. &nbsp;I did Chest &amp; Back, Ab Ripper X and I did Plyometrics. &nbsp;I feel sore everywhere. &nbsp;Those workouts totally kicked my butt. &nbsp;I had to cheat on several of them (he says you can and sometimes even gives alternate&#47;easier&nbsp;ways to do it). &nbsp;I'm pretty excited to get into better shape!</p>
<p>The last thing that I'm doing with this workout is I'm trying to follow the recommended diet. &nbsp;I'm only doing it loosely though. &nbsp;Basically, I read what they've asked me to do and it seems really difficult to follow exactly, so I'm just making sure that I don't go too far off of the diet. &nbsp;The first phase of the diet is the fat shredder phase. &nbsp;Basically, I'm supposed&nbsp;to have 7 servings of protein, 1 serving of carbs, 4 servings of veggies... it's not easy. &nbsp;My modified version of the diet means that I eat as much protein as I can, as few carbs as I can as I try to eat more fruits and vegetables than I'm used to.</p>
<p>Well, I guess that's my story for now. &nbsp;I'll keep you posted as I go through it to let you know how it's working out for me. &nbsp;The key is to stick to it and really&nbsp;bring it!</p>

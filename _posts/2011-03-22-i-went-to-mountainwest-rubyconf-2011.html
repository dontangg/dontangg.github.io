<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-230"></a>Probably the biggest surprise for me was that I expected for all of the sessions to be centered around Ruby and for everyone to discourage all other languages, but they weren't and they didn't.&nbsp; Here is a short list of things that I noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby coders are not Ruby exclusive.<&#47;li>
<li>Coding is actually called hacking.<&#47;li>
<li>Ruby really is a community (so many things about what everyone considers "core" to Ruby were contributed by other people).<&#47;li>
<li>Bioinformaticians exist.&nbsp; I met one and he enjoys his job in Arizona!<&#47;li>
<li>There are lots of Ruby on Rails jobs in Utah.<&#47;li>
<li>Ruby development is largely Mac-centric with some linux.&nbsp; Windows users are made fun of (light-heartedly).<&#47;li>
<li>Everyone is nice and willing to help you and eager to learn (MINASWAN).<&#47;li>
<li>IRC is a great way to ask&#47;collaborate with other developers.<&#47;li>
<li>There is a big community of Ruby developers in Utah at <a title="Utah Ruby Users Group" href="https:&#47;&#47;groups.google.com&#47;forum&#47;?pli=1#!forum&#47;urug">URUG<&#47;a> that meet together monthly.<&#47;li>
<li>Twitter is used way more than I thought.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
I tried to keep that first list to things that were less techy.&nbsp; Here is a list of more technical cool things that I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are lots of well-developed Ruby interpreters (MRI, JRuby, Rubinius, MacRuby, Maglev).<&#47;li>
<li>If you're unhappy with your tools, you should write your own.<&#47;li>
<li><a title="Citrus" href="http:&#47;&#47;mjijackson.com&#47;citrus&#47;index.html">Citrus<&#47;a> is a great way to parse.<&#47;li>
<li>I want to participate more in the community (ie. <a title="Rails Mentors" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.railsmentors.org&#47;">Rails Mentors<&#47;a> or <a title="Ruby Summer of Code" href="http:&#47;&#47;rubysoc.org&#47;">Ruby Summer of Code<&#47;a> among other things if they do it again).<&#47;li>
<li>I want to <a title="Try Redis" href="http:&#47;&#47;try.redis-db.com&#47;">try Redis<&#47;a> and <a title="Try MongoDB" href="http:&#47;&#47;try.mongodb.org&#47;">MongoDB<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>You can create a website using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;pages.github.com&#47;">GitHub pages<&#47;a> for free.<&#47;li>
<li>There is a cool Ruby University that is free called <a title="Ruby Mendicant University" href="http:&#47;&#47;university.rubymendicant.com&#47;">Ruby Mendicant University<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li><a title="The Pragmatic Bookshelf | Seven Languages in Seven Weeks" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.pragprog.com&#47;titles&#47;btlang&#47;seven-languages-in-seven-weeks">Learn 7 languages in 7 weeks<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>There are better ways to handle concurrency than just using threads (<a title="Concurrency with Actors, Goroutines &amp; Ruby" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.igvita.com&#47;2010&#47;12&#47;02&#47;concurrency-with-actors-goroutines-ruby&#47;">read more<&#47;a>).<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
I also learned some quirky things about the guys in general.&nbsp; They like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Minecraft" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.minecraft.net&#47;">Minecraft<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li>sparkly unicorns<&#47;li>
<li>beer<&#47;li>
<li>random animal sounds<&#47;li>
<li>sombreros<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Overall, it was a really interesting, fun experience.&nbsp; I'm glad I went.&nbsp; I learned lots of interesting things and it changed my outlook on different languages and programming in general!</p>

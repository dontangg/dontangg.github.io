  content: "I apologize for the multiplayer experience.  Many people can get it to
    work just fine, but some can't.  This is definitely something that I'm working
    on.\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback.  I actually have a site where you can submit
    ideas and vote on them.  You can find it here: http:&#47;&#47;blackbird1.uservoice.com."

<h3><em>My name is <span style="color: #009933;">Don<&#47;span>. I live in Utah. I'm 29 years old.<&#47;em><&#47;h3><br />
Right now, I'm a software engineer for <a title="Visit my employer" href="http:&#47;&#47;ancestry.com&#47;" target="_blank">Ancestry.com<&#47;a>. I have always enjoyed computers. When I was four years old, I played Dark Castle on our Mac. When I was ten I made a computer game using HyperCard. In High School I made several games and programs for my TI-85 calculator. I graduated in Bioinformatics (figure that one out). These days, I love everything to do with developing and designing for the web.</p>
<p>Even though I'm kind of a computer geek, I have a wide variety of other interests. I'm a big fan of college football. I play the piano. I enjoy playing indoor soccer, racquetball, and many other sports.</p>
<p>I never have been good at writing and I've never been a blogger, but I see value in writing and sharing my thoughts and opinions. I'm hoping that I'll enjoy this. &nbsp;We'll see!</p>
